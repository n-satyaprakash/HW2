            <h2>Quote from The Witcher Books</h2>
            <p>“Evil is evil, Stregobor. Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred.” - Andrzej Sapkowski, The Last Wish</p>
            <p>"I've been forced to make many hard choices. Who to fight, who to spare, who to kill. Now I have to choose the lesser evil. Again and again. No matter what I do, it always comes back to that. And I'm tired of choosing. I just want to live, or at least die in peace." - Andrzej Sapkowski, "Blood of Elves"</p>
